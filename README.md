# 🧠 MindMate

**MindMate** is an AI-powered thought tracker and productivity assistant built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, just clean, modern code.

This app lets you write out your thoughts, and the AI responds with emotional insight and task suggestions. From there, you can click on suggested tasks to add them to your personal task list, where you can manage your progress.
